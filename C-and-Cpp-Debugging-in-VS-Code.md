## Prerequisites

First, go to the extensions panel in VS Code and search for `C/C++`. Choose the extension by Microsoft (ms-vscode.cpptools).

Install that extension and restart VSC.


## Building the Project in VSC

What we want to be able to do is build the project with CTRL-SHIFT-B (or COMMAND-SHIFT-B).

The `tasks.json` file controls which tasks VSC can run. The one we're interested in is the Default Build Task.

1. With VSC open to your root project directory, hit CTRL-SHIFT-P (or COMMAND-SHIFT-P).
2. Type `tasks` and choose "Tasks: Configure Default Build Task".
3. Choose "Create tasks.json file from template".
4. Choose "Others".

At this point you should be editing `tasks.json`.

1. Change the `label` to something representative, like `Build`
2. Change the `command` to the command you want to run, like `gcc -Wall -o foo foo.c` or `make`
3. Hit CTRL-SHIFT-P (or COMMAND-SHIFT-P) again.
4. Type `default` and choose "Tasks: Configure Default Build Task" again.
5. Select the value you put in for `label` in step 1.
6. Save `tasks.json`.

At this point, your `tasks.json` should look something like this:

```javascript
{
  // See https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733558
  // for the documentation about the tasks.json format
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "label": "Build",
      "type": "shell",
      "command": "make",
      "group": {
        "kind": "build",
        "isDefault": true
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Now you should be able to hit CTRL-SHIFT-B (or COMMAND-SHIFT-B) and see a build.

### Adding PROBLEMS Panel Support (OPTIONAL)

Adding a _Problem Matcher_ will automatically extract error information from the build and put it in the PROBLEMS panel to make it easier to jump to those line numbers.

Here is a `tasks.json` file with a [`problemMatcher` for C/C++](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks#_defining-a-problem-matcher) added in:

```javascript
{
  // See https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733558
  // for the documentation about the tasks.json format
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "label": "Build",
      "type": "shell",
      "command": "make",
      "group": {
        "kind": "build",
        "isDefault": true
      },
      "problemMatcher": {
        "owner": "cpp",
        "fileLocation": ["relative", "${workspaceFolder}"],
        "pattern": {
          "regexp": "^(.*):(\\d+):(\\d+):\\s+(warning|error):\\s+(.*)$",
          "file": 1,
          "line": 2,
          "column": 3,
          "severity": 4,
          "message": 5
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

`tasks.json` will be found in the `.vscode/` directory in the project workspace.


## Debugging the Project in VSC

**IMPORTANT**: You *must* build your C code with the `-g` switch to `gcc` or `clang`. This causes debugging information to be included in the binary.

### Setting up the Debugger

To set up debugging, perform the following steps:

1. Open the debugging panel (with the "anti-bug" symbol on the left).
2. Where it says "No Configurations on the top, pull down that menu.
3. Choose "Add Configuration".
4. Choose C++
5. It'll pop up an editor for `launch.json`. Edit the `name` to be something you like, e.g. "My Server"
6. Change `program` to be the name of your binary from the build step, e.g. `"${workspaceFolder}/myserver"`
7. If you are using `fork()`, it might be helpful to modify GDB's `detach-on-fork` setting to `off` in `setupCommands`.`text`, for example:

    `"text": "-enable-pretty-printing -gdb-set detach-on-fork off",`

8. Save `launch.json`.

Example `launch.json`:

```javascript
{
  // Use IntelliSense to learn about possible attributes.
  // Hover to view descriptions of existing attributes.
  // For more information, visit: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=830387
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [

    {
      "name": "Hello world",
      "type": "cppdbg",
      "request": "launch",
      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/hello",
      "args": [],
      "stopAtEntry": false,
      "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
      "environment": [],
      "externalConsole": true,
      "MIMode": "gdb",
      "setupCommands": [
        {
          "description": "Enable pretty-printing for gdb and add better child debugging",
          "text": "-enable-pretty-printing -gdb-set detach-on-fork off",
          "ignoreFailures": true
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

`launch.json` will be found in the `.vscode/` directory in the project workspace.

### Running the Debugger

1. Perform a build.
2. In the editor for the file you wish to debug, click just left of the line number where you want a breakpoint. A red dot will appear.
3. In the debugger panel, click the green run arrow at the top, or select `Debug`â†’`Start Debugging`, or hit `F5`.
4. The run should break on the line with the breakpoint.

**If the run doesn't break on the line you specified you probably didn't compile with the `-g` switch for `gcc` or `clang`. Make sure to rebuild.**

#### Variables

The debugging panel will show local variables in the `VARIABLES` pane. You can add expressions to watch in the `WATCH` pane, e.g.

```c
node->next->val
```

If you have a `char a[1000]` that you want to view as a string instead of an array, add this to the `WATCH` section:

```c
(char *)a
```

#### Console I/O

Console input and output will be in another window that pops up. It might hide behind the VSCode window, so look for it there.

#### Controls

Once you've hit the breakpoint, you can do one of these main things:

* **Continue**: `F5` or green arrow. Keep running to the next breakpoint or the end.
* **Step Over**: `F10` or "jump over" icon. Execute this line and go to the next without entering any functions.
* **Step Into**: `F11` or "down arrow" icon. If this line is a function call, step into that function.
* **Step Out**: `SHIFT-F11` or "up arrow" icon. Continue running until you get out of this function.

See the "Debug" pulldown menu for all options.


Happy hacking!
